The sky looked unusually bright this evening.
A quiet breeze moved through the trees.
Someone left a cup of coffee on the window sill.
The clock ticked louder than usual.
A cat crossed the road and disappeared.
Music played softly from a distant room.
The street lights flickered once and stayed on.
It felt like the start of something new.
